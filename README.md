# Libft

This repository contains my implementation of ‘Libft’, a library of commonly used C functions. ‘Libft’ project is part of the curriculum at 42, designed to understand the standard C library functions better and to encourage good programming practices.

## Requirements

To use this library, you need:
+ a C compiler (e.g., gcc)
+ 'make' utility
